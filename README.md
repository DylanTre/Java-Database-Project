# Java-Database-Project
I made a project with local database. This project runs all computers. Normally, you have to reconfigure the database file for your computer but with this project you don't have to. I made my own sql file which is name "survey.sql", and i turned this .sqlite file which is name "data.sqlite". My app use this database file.
